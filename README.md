# 💡 Project Overview

## 🔹 What is LOCO WIND DYNAMO?

The **Loco Wind Dynamo** project involves installing wind turbines on top of trains to harness wind energy and convert it into electricity. The generated electricity powers onboard applications, reducing dependence on traditional energy sources and promoting sustainability. 

---

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern trains rely heavily on conventional energy sources. There is a need to:

* Reduce carbon emissions
* Improve energy efficiency
* Utilize renewable energy sources
* Promote eco-friendly transportation

# ⚙️ Working Principle

The system works based on **electromagnetic induction (Faraday’s Law)**.

### 🔄 Step-by-Step Working:

1. **Wind Turbine (Savonius Type)**
   Blades capture wind pressure and convert kinetic energy. 

2. **PM Generator**
   Converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. 

3. **Electromagnetic Induction**
   Changing magnetic field induces electric current. 

4. **LiFePO4 Battery**
   Stores electricity efficiently for later use. 

5. **Inverter**
   Converts stored DC power into usable AC power for loads.
